# libft @ 42

This is the libft project for 42. It consists in recreating various functions
from the standard C library as well as some extra useful functions into our
own libft.

## Compiling

Run `make` to compile all .c sources into a `libft.a`. To use it in your
project with gcc: `gcc (files) -L. -lft -I.`.

## For 42 students

Hey, don't copy code if you don't understand it. Some of it might even be
wrong! If you want to chat, I'm usually available through our Slack team. You
can find me with my GitHub username/42 login :)!

**Good luck and thanks for all the fish!**
